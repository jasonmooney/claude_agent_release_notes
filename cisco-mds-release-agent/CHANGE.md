Requested by: jasmoone
Prompt: Fix AttributeError in main.py where 'DataConsolidationAgent' object has no attribute 'get_consolidated_data'
Reasoning: The main.py file was attempting to call a non-existent method `get_consolidated_data()` on the DataConsolidationAgent class. The consolidated data is stored as an attribute `consolidated_data`, not accessed through a method. This caused an AttributeError when trying to run the application.
Changed: Modified main.py to access the `consolidated_data` attribute directly instead of calling the non-existent `get_consolidated_data()` method.
Modified Files: src/main.py
GitHub Commit Summary: Fix AttributeError by accessing consolidated_data attribute instead of calling non-existent method

Requested by: jasmoone
Prompt: Fix additional AttributeError in main.py where 'AIQueryAssistant' object has no attribute 'start_interaction' and validate the complete application
Reasoning: After fixing the first AttributeError, a second issue was discovered where main.py was calling a non-existent 'start_interaction()' method on the AIQueryAssistant class. The application needed proper initialization and demonstration functionality without calling non-existent methods.
Changed: Modified main.py to remove the call to the non-existent 'start_interaction()' method and added proper initialization messages and demonstration of available query methods. Conducted comprehensive validation testing to ensure the application runs successfully.
Modified Files: src/main.py
GitHub Commit Summary: Fix second AttributeError and add proper initialization flow with validation testing
