  - AI Query Assistant (AQA) for natural language querying of consolidated data.
  - Various parsers for handling different types of release notes (NX-OS, EPLD, Transceiver).
  - Data handling utilities for YAML file management and caching.
  - Logging and web scraping utilities.

### Modified

Requested by: jasmoone
Prompt: Fix AttributeError in main.py where 'DataConsolidationAgent' object has no attribute 'get_consolidated_data'
Reasoning: The main.py file was attempting to call a non-existent method `get_consolidated_data()` on the DataConsolidationAgent class. The consolidated data is stored as an attribute `consolidated_data`, not accessed through a method. This caused an AttributeError when trying to run the application.
Changed: Modified main.py to access the `consolidated_data` attribute directly instead of calling the non-existent `get_consolidated_data()` method.
Modified Files: src/main.py
GitHub Commit Summary: Fix AttributeError by accessing consolidated_data attribute instead of calling non-existent method

Requested by: jasmoone
Prompt: Fix additional AttributeError in main.py where 'AIQueryAssistant' object has no attribute 'start_interaction' and validate the complete application
Reasoning: After fixing the first AttributeError, a second issue was discovered where main.py was calling a non-existent 'start_interaction()' method on the AIQueryAssistant class. The application needed proper initialization and demonstration functionality without calling non-existent methods.
Changed: Modified main.py to remove the call to the non-existent 'start_interaction()' method and added proper initialization messages and demonstration of available query methods. Conducted comprehensive validation testing to ensure the application runs successfully.
Modified Files: src/main.py
GitHub Commit Summary: Fix second AttributeError and add proper initialization flow with validation testing

Requested by: jasmoone
Prompt: Can we run the agentic agent please to gather and consolidate the information.
Reasoning: The user requested to run the Data Consolidation Agent to actually fetch and process Cisco MDS release notes. The existing DCA implementation was placeholder code, so it needed to be fully implemented with web scraping, parsing, and data consolidation functionality to meet the System Requirements Specification.
Changed: Implemented a fully functional Data Consolidation Agent with web scraping capabilities, YAML data storage, and proper error handling. Successfully fetched 101 potential release note links from Cisco's website, processed 5 EPLD release notes, and stored structured data in upgrade_paths.yaml format as specified in the SRS.
Modified Files: 
- src/agents/data_consolidation_agent.py (complete implementation)
- scripts/analyze_data.py (created new analysis script)
- data/output/upgrade_paths.yaml (generated consolidated data)
GitHub Commit Summary: Implement functional Data Consolidation Agent with web scraping and YAML data consolidation

Requested by: jasmoone
Prompt: Focus on "Cisco MDS 9000 Series Release Notes" and "Release Notes for Cisco MDS 9000 Series" (NX-OS) instead of EPLD Release Notes for initial phase
Reasoning: The user correctly pointed out that the initial phase should focus on the main NX-OS release notes, not EPLD release notes. EPLD notes are rarely used, while NX-OS release notes are the most commonly used and contain the critical upgrade path and bug fix information needed by TAC engineers and customers. The SRS specified focusing on NX-OS/SAN-OS release notes first.
Changed: Updated the Data Consolidation Agent to properly identify and prioritize NX-OS release notes over EPLD notes. Added intelligent filtering to focus on "Cisco MDS 9000 Series Release Notes" and "Release Notes for Cisco MDS 9000 Series" patterns. Successfully identified 56 NX-OS release notes vs 45 other types. Enhanced data structure to include proper upgrade paths, downgrade paths, and resolved bugs for NX-OS releases as per SRS specification.
Modified Files:
- src/agents/data_consolidation_agent.py (updated filtering and classification logic)
- data/output/upgrade_paths.yaml (regenerated with NX-OS focus)
GitHub Commit Summary: Refocus Data Consolidation Agent on NX-OS release notes instead of EPLD notes per SRS requirements
