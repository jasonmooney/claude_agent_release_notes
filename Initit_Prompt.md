Okay, this is an excellent goal. By starting fresh with a well-structured requirements document that incorporates all your learnings, you can significantly improve the efficiency and outcome of an AI-assisted development process.
Here's a comprehensive "System Requirements Specification" (SRS) designed to guide the development of your Cisco MDS Release Note Agentic System. This document emphasizes clarity, decoupling of agents, and detailed data handling â€“ all crucial for LLM-driven development.
System Requirements Specification: Cisco MDS Release Note Agentic System
Version: 1.0
Date: May 25, 2025
Project Owner: (Your Name/Team)
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Vision: To develop an advanced agentic system that automates the consolidation and interpretation of Cisco MDS 9000 series device release information. This system will empower Cisco TAC engineers and customers to quickly and accurately determine upgrade/downgrade paths, identify currently recommended NX-OS releases, understand defect fixes between versions, and access relevant release and recommendation dates.
1.2 Project Goals:
Develop a robust Data Consolidation Agent (DCA) to autonomously gather, parse, and structure information from various Cisco MDS release note documents.
Develop an intelligent AI Query Assistant (AQA) that leverages the consolidated data to answer user queries in natural language.
Ensure data accuracy and timeliness through regular updates and comprehensive parsing logic.
Provide a reliable and efficient tool that reduces manual research time and improves decision-making for MDS software management.
Design a maintainable and scalable system.
1.3 Scope:
In Scope:
Processing of Cisco MDS 9000 Series Release Notes (NX-OS/SAN-OS), EPLD Release Notes, Transceiver Firmware Release Notes, and the official "Recommended Releases for Cisco MDS 9000 Series Switches" page.
Extraction of Open-Systems and FICON upgrade/downgrade paths.
Extraction of recommended release information (Open-Systems and FICON), prioritizing "With Smart Licensing" versions.
Extraction of resolved defect (Bug ID) information from NX-OS release notes.
Extraction of initial release dates for software versions and EPLDs.
Extraction of dates when specific versions became "recommended."
Storing consolidated data in a structured YAML format.
Answering user queries via an LLM-powered interface regarding the extracted information.
Caching mechanism for fetched data.
Integration with Langchain, Langsmith, and a specified Google Gemini LLM.
Adherence to specified development environment and coding standards (Python 3, venv, WSL Ubuntu, PEP 8).
Version control using Git with the specified repository.
Okta integration for potential future secured access (details to be confirmed for specific agent interfaces if needed).
Out of Scope (for initial version, unless specified otherwise):
Processing release notes for products other than Cisco MDS 9000 series.
Real-time alerts for new release note publications (system will rely on scheduled refreshes).
Direct integration with Cisco TAC case management systems (AQA is a standalone query tool).
Automated software deployment or switch configuration.
Parsing of "Storage Services Interface Image Release" notes (these should be explicitly skipped).

2. System Architecture Overview
The system will consist of two distinct, decoupled agents:
2.1 Data Consolidation Agent (DCA):
Purpose: This agent is responsible for all interactions with the Cisco website, fetching raw release note documents (HTML and PDF as appropriate), parsing them, extracting relevant information, structuring this information, and saving it into a central, well-defined data store (YAML file).
Characteristics: Primarily a backend, automated process. Focus on robust parsing, data accuracy, and efficient data transformation.
Diagram:
[Cisco Website (Release Notes URLs)] --> [DCA: Fetcher -> Parser -> Structurer -> Validator] --> [Consolidated Data Store (upgrade_paths.yaml)]


2.2 AI Query Assistant (AQA):
Purpose: This agent provides a natural language interface for users to ask questions about the data consolidated by the DCA. It uses an LLM, contextualized with the data from the YAML file, to generate answers.
Characteristics: User-facing (potentially via CLI or a simple API initially). Focus on natural language understanding, accurate information retrieval from the structured data, and clear, helpful response generation.
Diagram:
[User Query (Natural Language)] --> [AQA: LLM Interface (Langchain) + System Prompt] --> [LLM (Gemini)]
                                                       ^
                                                       |
                                       [Consolidated Data Store (upgrade_paths.yaml) as Context]


2.3 Rationale for Decoupling:
Maintainability: Allows independent development, testing, and updating of data extraction logic (DCA) and AI interaction logic (AQA).
Scalability: Data processing and query handling can be scaled independently.
Flexibility: The structured data output from DCA could potentially be used by other tools or systems in the future, not just the AQA. The AQA could also potentially leverage different LLMs or data sources with modifications.
Robustness: Issues in one agent are less likely to directly impact the other (e.g., if a Cisco webpage changes format, only DCA needs updating; AQA continues to work with the last good dataset).
3. Detailed Requirements: Data Consolidation Agent (DCA)
3.1 Objective: To autonomously and accurately extract all specified information from Cisco MDS 9000 series release documentation and store it in a structured, version-controlled YAML file.
3.2 Primary Data Sources:
3.2.1 Main Release Notes Index URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/storage-networking/mds-9000-nx-os-san-os-software/products-release-notes-list.html (This is the primary entry point to discover individual release note links).
3.2.2 Recommended Releases Page URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/mds9000/sw/b_MDS_NX-OS_Recommended_Releases.html
3.3 Core Functionality & Logic:
3.3.1 Release Note Discovery:
The DCA shall periodically scan the Main Release Notes Index URL (3.2.1) to identify links to individual release note documents.
It shall classify links into:
Cisco MDS 9000 Series Release Notes (NX-OS/SAN-OS)
Cisco MDS 9000 Series EPLD Release Notes
Cisco MDS 9000 Series Transceiver Firmware Release Notes
It shall explicitly skip any links identified as "Cisco MDS 9000 Family Release Notes for Storage Services Interface Image Release."
3.3.2 Document Fetching & Pre-processing:
The DCA shall download the content of identified release notes. HTML format is preferred if available; PDF parsing capabilities may be required as a fallback for older documents or specific information types not well-represented in HTML. Developer Note: Prioritize robust HTML parsing. PDF parsing introduces significant complexity and should be a secondary goal if HTML is insufficient.
Downloaded files shall be stored locally temporarily for processing.
Filename Normalization: All saved release note files (and references within the YAML) must follow a consistent, predictable naming convention that includes the version and type (e.g., cisco-mds-9000-nx-os-release-notes-9.4.3a-nxos.html, cisco-mds-9000-nx-os-release-notes-8.4.1a-epld.html).
The normalization logic must correctly handle variations in version numbering found in links/titles (e.g., "9.2(1)" -> 921, "8.4(2f)" -> 842f).
The type suffix (-nxos, -epld, -transceiver) is mandatory.
3.3.3 Data Extraction - NX-OS/SAN-OS Release Notes:
For each NX-OS release note:
Release Version: Extract the specific NX-OS version (e.g., "9.4(3a)").
Initial Release Date: Extract the date the version was initially released. This is often found near the document title, in a "First Published" field, or within the document's introductory text or change history. If an exact date is unavailable, a copyright year or document property date may be a last resort, clearly noted as such.
Upgrade Paths (Non-Disruptive):
Locate sections titled similarly to "Open Systems Nondisruptive Upgrade Paths" and "FICON Nondisruptive Upgrade Paths."
Parse tables within these sections. These tables typically list source versions (or ranges) and the required intermediate steps to upgrade to the target version of this release note.
Critical Logic for Upgrade Path Parsing (Lessons Learned):
Must accurately capture source_range (e.g., specific versions like "8.4(2c)", wildcards like "*", ranges like "Any 8.x prior to 8.4(2c)", "All 9.x releases"). These ranges need to be parsable/interpretable by the AQA.
Must accurately capture steps as an ordered list of intermediate versions required for the upgrade.
Handle multi-column tables, merged cells, and footnotes or caveats associated with paths.
Differentiate clearly between Open-Systems and FICON paths.
Example for LLM/Developer: For target release 9.4(3a), if a table states "Any 8.x prior to 8.4(2c)" requires "Step 1: Upgrade to 8.4(2c) [or 8.4(2d/2e/2f)], Step 2: Upgrade to 9.4(3a)", this multi-step conditional path must be captured accurately. A simple source_range: '*' for a direct upgrade to 9.4(3a) might also exist but would be superseded by this more specific rule for applicable source versions. The data structure or AQA logic must handle this precedence.
Downgrade Paths (Non-Disruptive):
Locate sections titled similarly to "Open Systems Nondisruptive Downgrade Paths" and "FICON Nondisruptive Downgrade Paths."
Parse these tables similarly to upgrade paths, noting source versions and downgrade steps.
Resolved Issues (Bug Fixes):
Locate sections like "Resolved Issues," "Caveats Resolved," or "Fixed Bugs."
Extract a list of Bug IDs (e.g., CSCxx12345) and their associated descriptions/summaries that were resolved in this specific release.
Handling Format Variations: Be aware that release notes for older versions (e.g., pre-9.2(1)) may have significantly different HTML structures and section titles. The parsing logic must be adaptable or have specific rules for these variations.
3.3.4 Data Extraction - EPLD Release Notes:
For each EPLD release note:
Release Version/Identifier: Extract the EPLD release identifier.
Release Date: Extract the date of this EPLD release.
Hardware/PMFPGA Versions: Parse tables that list hardware device types/modules and their corresponding PMFPGA (or similar EPLD component) versions for this EPLD release.
Disruption Notice: Note that EPLD upgrades are disruptive (require a reload). This characteristic should be associated with EPLD data.
Critical Logic for EPLD Table Parsing (Lessons Learned): EPLD tables can have complex structures, extra header rows, merged cells, and empty/whitespace rows. The parsing logic must:
Dynamically detect the true header row.
Skip empty rows, repeated headers, and section label rows.
Only extract rows matching the header length with a minimum number of non-empty cells (e.g., at least two).
3.3.5 Data Extraction - Transceiver Firmware Release Notes:
For each Transceiver Firmware release note:
Release Version/Identifier.
Release Date.
Supported Transceivers and Firmware Versions: Parse tables listing transceiver models and their firmware versions in this release.
3.3.6 Data Extraction - Recommended Releases Page:
Fetch and parse the "Recommended Releases for Cisco MDS 9000 Series Switches" page (URL 3.2.2).
Recommended Versions (Open-Systems & FICON):
Identify sections titled "General Recommendation for New Deployments" (interpret as "Open-Systems Recommendation") and "Recommendation for FICON Environments."
Within these sections, parse tables that list hardware platforms/series (e.g., MDS 9700, 9300, etc.) and their corresponding recommended NX-OS versions.
Prioritize "With Smart Licensing" releases as the current primary recommendation within these tables.
Extract the release version and the date it became recommended (often found in a "Change History" table on the same page or as part of the table entry).
Change History Table:
Parse the "Change History" table to extract dates when overall recommendations were updated (e.g., "Updated the document with Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 9.4(3a) as the recommend release."). This provides context for recommended_date.
The latest entries in this table for "Open-Systems" and "FICON" often represent the absolute latest top-level recommendation and should supersede individual platform recommendations if there's a discrepancy in recency.
Contextual Information: Note that recommendations for older series (e.g., 8.x, early 9.x) are likely outdated even if listed. The AQA will need to be guided on how to present this.
3.4 Data Structuring & Output (YAML Format):
All extracted data shall be consolidated into a single YAML file named upgrade_paths.yaml.
The YAML structure should be designed for clarity, efficiency for LLM context, and ease of parsing by the AQA.
Proposed High-Level YAML Structure:
YAML
# upgrade_paths.yaml
metadata:
  last_updated_utc: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" # Timestamp of when this file was last generated

Schema Considerations:
source_range_logic: This needs careful definition to allow the AQA to correctly match a user's current version. Options include simple strings, regex, or a small structured object (as shown in example).
Consistency in version numbering (e.g., always use X.Y.Za format internally if possible).
Clearly define how "steps" are listed (is the target version implicitly the last step or explicitly listed?).
3.5 Caching & Refresh Mechanism:
The DCA shall cache downloaded release note files to avoid re-fetching unchanged documents.
The DCA shall have a mechanism to refresh its entire dataset (upgrade_paths.yaml).
The refresh shall be scheduled to run automatically (e.g., twice a week on Saturday and Wednesday, as per original prompt). A manual trigger should also be available.
During a refresh, compare fetched content (e.g., using ETag, Last-Modified headers, or content hash) to cached versions before re-parsing to save processing time.
3.6 Error Handling & Logging:
Log all major operations, errors, and warnings to a local log file.
Handle network errors, HTTP errors, and parsing errors gracefully.
If a specific document cannot be parsed, log the error and continue with other documents if possible.
Maintain a status of the last successful update and any errors encountered.
3.7 Development & Operational Environment:
Python 3 (latest stable).
Operate within a Python virtual environment (venv).
Primary development and execution environment: WSL (Ubuntu) on Windows.
VSCode as the recommended IDE, with interpreter correctly set.
All Python code must adhere to PEP 8 standards.
requirements.txt must be kept up-to-date with all modules and their dependencies (e.g., requests, beautifulsoup4, PyYAML, lxml).
4. Detailed Requirements: AI Query Assistant (AQA)
4.1 Objective: To provide an intelligent, natural language interface for users to query the consolidated Cisco MDS release information, leveraging an LLM and the data stored in upgrade_paths.yaml.
4.2 Input Data Source: The AQA shall exclusively use the upgrade_paths.yaml file generated by the DCA as its knowledge base for Cisco MDS release information. It should not attempt to access the internet or other external sources for this data.
4.3 Core Capabilities (Query Types): The AQA must be able to answer questions related to:
4.3.1 Upgrade/Downgrade Paths:
"What is the upgrade path from version X.Y(Za) to Z.A(Bc) for Open-Systems?"
"Can I upgrade directly from 6.2(11) to 9.4(3a) FICON?"
"What are the downgrade options from 9.3(2)?"
"I'm on 8.3(1), what's the recommended upgrade path to the latest recommended Open-Systems release?"
4.3.2 Recommended Releases:
"What is the current recommended NX-OS release for MDS 9700 in an Open-Systems environment?"
"Which version is recommended for FICON?"
"When did 9.4(3a) become the recommended release?"
"Tell me about the recommended release for 8.x systems." (Should provide the latest 8.x recommendation and context about its age vs. current Smart Licensing recommendations).
4.3.3 Defect (Bug Fix) Information:
"What bugs were fixed between version 8.4(2a) and 8.4(2f)?"
"Does release 9.3(2) include a fix for CSCxx12345?"
"List resolved issues in version 9.4(1a)."
4.3.4 Release Dates & Timelines:
"When was NX-OS 9.2(1) released?"
"How old is version 6.2(11)?"
"What's the release date for EPLD package X?"
4.3.5 Combined Queries:
"I'm running 8.3(1) and want to upgrade to the latest recommended Open-Systems release. What's the path, and what major bugs would be fixed if my current version had known issues A, B, C?"
4.4 LLM Integration:
Framework: Langchain shall be used to manage interactions with the LLM.
Observability: Langsmith shall be integrated for tracing and debugging LLM calls (API keys and environment variables to be configured).
LLM Model: Google Gemini Pro (specifically "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06" or latest equivalent, configurable). API key to be managed via .env file.
Context Management: The AQA will load the upgrade_paths.yaml file. A summarized or relevant subset of this data will be passed as context in the prompt to the LLM. Developer Note: Be mindful of LLM context window limits. Develop a strategy to provide only the most relevant parts of the YAML based on the user's query, or summarize effectively.
4.5 System Prompt Engineering: The quality of AQA responses heavily depends on the system prompt. The prompt must instruct the LLM on:
Persona: "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Cisco MDS 9000 series software releases. Your goal is to provide accurate, concise, and helpful information based solely on the provided structured data (YAML context)."
Knowledge Source: "All your answers MUST be derived from the YAML data provided. Do not invent information or access external knowledge."
Data Interpretation:
Explain the structure of upgrade_paths.yaml (key sections like recommended_releases, releases, structure of upgrade/downgrade paths, source_range_logic, resolved_bugs).
How to interpret source_range_logic to match a user's version against available paths, including precedence (e.g., specific ranges over wildcards).
How to identify and present "Open-Systems" vs. "FICON" information.
How to interpret recommended_releases, prioritizing "With Smart Licensing" versions and using recommended_since dates correctly.
How to explain that older recommendations (e.g., for 8.x) are significantly aged compared to current recommendations and lack recent security fixes.
How to calculate/present defects fixed between two versions (i.e., bugs resolved in target version that were not resolved in source version).
The release_date in recommended_releases is when it became recommended, distinct from a version's initial_release_date.
Response Formatting: Request clear, easy-to-read responses. Use bullet points for lists (e.g., upgrade steps, bug lists).
Handling Ambiguity/Missing Info: "If the data does not contain a direct answer, state that the information is not available in the provided dataset. Do not guess. If a query is ambiguous, ask for clarification."
Example Interactions (Few-shot prompting): Include 2-3 examples of user questions and ideal answers based on a sample YAML structure.
Cautionary Notes:
"Remember that EPLD upgrades are disruptive."
"When discussing older versions, provide context about their age and highlight the benefits of moving to newer, supported, and security-patched releases."
4.6 Interaction Model:
Initially, the AQA can be a command-line tool where the user types their question as an argument (e.g., python test_ai_query.py "What is the upgrade path...").
The AQA shall print the LLM's textual response to the console.
4.7 Error Handling & Clarification:
If the LLM fails to generate a response or an API error occurs, provide a user-friendly error message.
If the user's query is unclear, the LLM (guided by the system prompt) should ask for clarification.
Log interactions and LLM responses for monitoring and improvement.
5. Cross-Cutting Concerns
5.1 Testing Strategy:
DCA - Unit Tests: Each parsing function (e.g., for specific table types, date extraction, filename normalization) must have unit tests with sample HTML/text inputs and expected outputs.
DCA - Integration Tests: Test the end-to-end data extraction for a small set of diverse release notes (old format, new format, NX-OS, EPLD) and verify the generated YAML snippet.
DCA - Golden Dataset Validation: Maintain a manually curated "golden" upgrade_paths.yaml for a representative subset of releases. The automated DCA output should be compared against this golden set.
AQA - Unit Tests: Test any helper functions for context preparation or API calls.
AQA - End-to-End (Query) Tests: A suite of predefined questions covering all core capabilities (5.3). Expected answer patterns or key information points should be defined. Developer Note: Exact LLM output can vary, so test for inclusion of critical information rather than exact string matches.
All tests shall be implemented using pytest.
5.2 Documentation:
README.md: Comprehensive documentation covering:
Project overview.
Setup instructions (environment, dependencies, API keys).
How to run the DCA (manual refresh).
How to use the AQA (example queries).
Description of the upgrade_paths.yaml structure.
How to run tests.
CHANGE.md: All significant changes (features, fixes, refactoring) must be logged with User ID (e.g., jasmoone), date/timestamp, and a summary including Prompt/Requirement, Reasoning, Implementation, and Files Changed/Created/Removed.
5.3 Version Control:
All code and documentation shall be managed in the Git repository: git@github.com:jasonmooney/agent_release_notes.git
Use meaningful commit messages.
Consider feature branches for significant changes.
5.4 Security:
Okta integration details (Client ID, Client Secret, Discovery Url provided in original prompt) should be securely managed (e.g., via environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism). The specific application of Okta (e.g., protecting a future API for AQA, or DCA management interface) needs to be defined if/when these interfaces are built. For now, ensure credentials are not hardcoded.
API keys (Gemini, Langsmith) must be loaded from a .env file and not committed to version control. Add .env to .gitignore.
5.5 Code Standards:
All Python code must strictly follow PEP 8 guidelines.
Code should be well-commented, especially for complex logic (e.g., parsing rules).
Strive for modular and reusable code.
6. Definition of "Done" / Acceptance Criteria (Examples)
DCA - Basic NX-OS Parsing:
Given: An HTML release note for NX-OS 9.3(2).
When: The DCA processes this document.
Then: The upgrade_paths.yaml shall contain an entry for "9.3.2" with the correct initial_release_date, at least one open_systems upgrade path, and a list of resolved_bugs (Bug IDs).
DCA - Recommended Release Parsing:
Given: The Cisco Recommended Releases page.
When: The DCA processes this page.
Then: upgrade_paths.yaml shall have a recommended_releases section populated with current Open-Systems and FICON recommendations, including version and recommended_since dates, prioritizing Smart Licensing versions.
AQA - Upgrade Path Query:
Given: A populated upgrade_paths.yaml with a multi-step path for 8.3(1) to 9.4(3a).
When: User asks "What is the upgrade path from 8.3(1) to 9.4(3a) for Open-Systems?"
Then: The AQA response shall accurately list the correct multi-step path as defined in the YAML, not a direct path based on a wildcard.
AQA - Defect Query:
Given: YAML with bug information for versions A, B, C.
When: User asks "What bugs are fixed between version A and version C (assuming B is an intermediate)?"
Then: The AQA response shall list Bug IDs present in C's resolved_bugs list but not in A's resolved_bugs (or bugs from B and C if that's the interpretation). Clarify exact logic for cumulative bug list.
7. Guidance for AI-Assisted Development
Feed this Document Iteratively: Provide this SRS to the development LLM section by section, or by agent (DCA first, then AQA).
Focus on Specificity: When the LLM generates code for parsing or data structuring, review it critically. If it's too generic, provide specific examples from this document (or actual HTML snippets) and ask for refinement. Refer to specific "Lessons Learned" notes in this document.
Prioritize Robust Data Extraction (DCA): The AQA's quality is entirely dependent on the DCA's output. Spend significant effort ensuring the DCA's parsing logic is as robust and accurate as possible, covering all the tricky cases you encountered previously.
Develop and Test DCA Data Output Schema Early: Before extensive AQA development, ensure the upgrade_paths.yaml structure is stable and accurately reflects the complexities of the source data. Manually create a small "golden" YAML file to test against.
Iterate on AQA System Prompt: The system prompt for the AQA is critical. Expect to refine it multiple times based on the AQA's responses to test queries. Use Langsmith to inspect how the LLM is using the context and instructions.
Use CHANGE.md Rigorously: Even with AI assistance, document each significant generation, refinement, or fix as if it were a manual change, noting the prompt that led to it. This maintains traceability.
Break Down Complex Tasks: If the LLM struggles with a large task (e.g., "write the entire DCA parser"), break it down: "Write a function to extract all H2 tags and their subsequent tables," then "Write a function to normalize version strings from these titles," etc.
This document provides a much more detailed and structured starting point. Remember that even with this level of detail, AI-assisted development will likely involve clarification, iteration, and refinement. The key is that you now have a strong baseline that captures past learnings and anticipates future complexities. Good luck!
